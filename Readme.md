MonogramPyAHKAutomator
======================
The goal of this program is to automate the setup process of new desktops and
laptops. The focus will be primarily on the automation of the install of
standard software used by all/most users. Secondary focus will be automation of
configurations.

There will be a Python foundation and GUI utilizing PyQt5. AHK will be used for
interacting with and observing GUIs of the software installers and configuration
wizards. Part of the Python foundation will be an ActionScheduler class which
will be responsible for the scheduling and execution of actions which will be
grouped into Actions objects.
